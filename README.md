# Project Board Application

This is a **Kanban board** application built using **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Material UI**. It allows you to manage tasks through a drag-and-drop interface and stores board data in the browserâ€™s `localStorage` to ensure persistence across page reloads.

## Features

- **Manage Tasks and Columns**: Add, edit, delete, and reorder tasks and columns.
- **Drag-and-Drop**: Rearrange tasks and columns using the drag-and-drop functionality.
- **Inline Editing**: Rename columns by clicking directly on their title.
- **Data Persistence**: Task and column data is saved in `localStorage` to retain board state on page reload.

## Technologies Used

- **Vite**: For fast build and development setup.
- **React + TypeScript**: For building a scalable and type-safe frontend.
- **Material UI**: For pre-designed UI components and consistent design.
- **localStorage**: To persist board data across browser sessions.
- **@dnd-kit/core**: For drag-and-drop functionality.
